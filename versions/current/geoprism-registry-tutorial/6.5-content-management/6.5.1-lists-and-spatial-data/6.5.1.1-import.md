# 6.5.1.1. Importing data

{% hint style="info" %}
Registry Administrators and Registry Maintainers can import the lists and spatial data of the Geo-Object Types under the curation mandate of their organization
{% endhint %}

To import Geo-Object data into GeoPrism Registry, we have to take into account the Geo-Object Types, attributes, and hierarchies that have been defined. The data to be imported needs to be formatted so the fields/columns can be mapped onto the attributes of the relevant Geo-Object Type, and where available, hierarchy information can be matched with the correct hierarchy.

## Importing a spreadsheet (list)

Lists are imported in GeoPrism Registry under the form of a spreadsheet.

To be able to smoothly import a list to GeoPrism Registry, the following basic requirements must be followed:

* The spreadsheet must be in XLSX format
* The spreadsheet must contain the values for all the attributes that have been defined in the data dictionary as well as the parents for the hierarchies the Geo-Object Type is a part of
* A header must exist on the first row that contains the unique label for each attribute
* Each column must be set to the appropriate data type
* The data should be in the first worksheet of the XLSX file; all other worksheets will be ignored by the system
* There should be no formulas in the spreadsheet as these are not supported
* Geographic coordinates included in the spreadsheet must be unprojected ([World Geodetic System 1984; EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326)) and stored in separated columns (latitude and longitude)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the spreadsheet has multiple tabs only the first tab will be used for the import
{% endhint %}

Importing a spreadsheet happens as follows:

1.  Go to the _Import_ module either by clicking the module icon on the homepage or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) in the upper right corner and selecting _Import_.\\

6. Click the **Submit** button in the _Spreadsheet import_ window.
7.  The _Attribute Matching_ window opens containing the attributes for the Geo-Object Type. The number of attributes that appears depends on the number of attributes created for the Geo-Object Type for which the spreadsheet is being imported. In the dropdown option for each field, choose the attribute from the list being imported that matches the created attribute of the Geo-Object Type. Click the **Next** button.\
    \
    _Note:_ When the spreadsheet is formatted correctly and completely as mentioned at the start of this section, you should be able to match all of its attributes to the Geo-Object Type for which it is being imported. Otherwise, some of the attributes will be left blank.

    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
8.  The _Hierarchy Matching_ window opens listing the Geo-Object Types considered as parents in to the Geo-Object Type for which the spreadsheet is being imported. The number of parent Geo-Object Types that will be listed depends on the position of the imported Geo-Object Type data in the hierarchy. Fill out the following fields for each parent Geo-Object Type:\\

    | Field                     | Description                                                                                                                                                     | Required |

## Importing a shapefile

Spatial data is imported into GeoPrism Registry through shapefiles.

To be able to smoothly import shapefiles into GeoPrism Registry, these basic requirements must be followed:

* The spatial data must be in [shapefile](https://support.esri.com/en/white-paper/279) format.
* As a shapefile consists of multiple files that collectively make up a shapefile, these files must be compressed into a zipped (.zip) file before importing.
* The shapefile must include data only for a single Geo-Object Type.
* The shapefile must be unprojected ([World Geodetic System 1984; EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326)). Otherwise, GeoPrism Registry will give an error message and the import will not take place.

Shapefiles are imported as follows:

1.  Go to the _Import_ module either by clicking the module icon on the homepage or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) in the upper right corner and selecting **Import**.\\
