# 6.5.1.3. Managing versions of a set

{% hint style="info" %}
Registry Administrators and Registry Maintainers can manage versions of a set created for the Geo-Object Types under the curation mandate of their organization.
{% endhint %}

Creating a set for a given Geo-Object Type generates two types of versions for each instance (list or spatial data) of this set:

* The _working version_ allows the authorized user to access the Geo-Object Type data either for viewing or editing. This version is generated automatically by GeoPrism Registry.
* The _published versions_ correspond to a snapshot in time of the Geo-Object Type data for the configured validity date or period. This type of version cannot be modified but can still be explored and exported.

1.  Go to the _Lists and Spatial Data_ module either by clicking the module icon on the homepage or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) on the upper right corner and selecting **Lists and Spatial Data**.\

2.  On the left sidebar, find the organization of which you are a member (this should be the first organization on the list). The Geo-Object Types that have been created are listed under each organization they belong to. Under your organization, click on the Geo-Object Type for which you would like to publish a version. In the example below, the _Community health worker (MOH)_ Geo-Object Type is selected.\

3.  Click on the name of the list and spatial data set for which you would like to publish a version. In the example below, the frequency-based set is selected.\

4.  Depending on the list type of the selected set as well as the frequency or the number of periods configured, there could be one or more validity dates or periods in the set. Find the validity date or period that you would like to publish a version for and click the **New Version** button.\

5.  The _Metadata_ window will open. This contains the metadata information of the list and spatial data set (see [section 6.5.1.2](6.5.1.2-create-a-set.md)). The metadata information of either the list or spatial data or both can be edited to reflect the information of the version being published.\

8. To explore the published version, follow the relevant steps in [section 6.5.1.4](6.5.1.4-explore.md).
9. To export the published version, follow the relevant steps in [section 6.5.1.7](6.5.1.7-export.md).
10. If changes are made to the working version of the list and/or spatial data, you can create another version of the dataset by repeating the relevant steps above.
11. The published version can also be deleted by clicking the **Delete** button and confirming the deletion when prompted.\
