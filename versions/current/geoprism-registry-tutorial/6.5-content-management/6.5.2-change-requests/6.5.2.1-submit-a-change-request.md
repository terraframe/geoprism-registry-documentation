# 6.5.2.1. Submitting a change request

A change request can be submitted by a Registry Contributor using specific modules depending on the nature of the request:

1. _Lists_ module for any type of request
2. _Explorer_ and _Change Requests_ modules for any type of requests, except requesting for a new Geo-Object to be added

## **Submitting a request to add a new Geo-Object**

A request to add a new Geo-Object can only be submitted by a Registry Contributor through the working version of the list for the relevant Geo-Object Type. This means that the Registry Contributor must have the curation role for that Geo-Object Type in order to submit such a request.

1.  Navigate to the _Lists and Spatial Data_ module either from the homepage or the burger menu.\

4.  Open the working version of the list for one of the instances of the list set.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
5.  Once the list opens, click the **Add Geo-Objects** button in the top right.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
6.  If you have selected a Geo-Object Type Group (health facility for example), a dropdown menu will appear once you click on the **Add Geo-Objects** button. In this menu, select the Geo-Object Type for which you would like to submit a request to add a Geo-Object.\


    <figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aI6xsBCsfzuBHW3tvEfu89u7LGKAR87opmBuP73h-h_Ft2S7ivlEwJwPBYgdQgUHx5GvHyhpdTLlNlf2aDCwKt_ZnHr15xim7G4vCaYGhpqNOhxIS4Olq3cRqpTgkhUHEH8eQpOHcQzz362jx1zeFq5pMxNsx7B7FKpanSrvQFQ92nYZcRNnRt2gnw" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
7.  The Geo-Object creation view opens, with the panel on the left, allowing you to set the period of existence, the attributes, the parents in the concerned hierarchies, and the geometry of the new Geo-Object.\


    <figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kxQ3FjRAbpLiLIAi5Jd3UWrcAvVNHrURvWarvKd5TaJPwD-4nJJF2qRjASHMr_x7UhiJS43azLfcGI_GV1k_vVE-phRel66oLE81r81_6WTh9cCbORENiJW-VLtLRkgmypA1FhayDZ4m_UgHZkVAu79WeUxNDl39yj1mKcWBEi_VpmTxXBba3X4QVA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
8.  Start by specifying the period of existence (start and end date) of the Geo-Object and keeping the validity as "Valid”.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-10-04 12-21-35.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
9. From there you can fill the information for the other tabs (_Attributes_, _Hierarchies_ and _Geometry_). Please refer to the list of attributes that are mandatory when adding a new Geo-Object to proceed (this should be documented in the relevant data dictionary for the Geo-Object Type).\
   \
   _Notes:_ (1) The temporal validity for the first instance of each attribute will have the same start and end date as the existence period specified under step 8. (2) The geometry of the Geo-Object can either be defined during the process described here or added by importing a shapefile (see [section 6.5.1.1](../6.5.1-lists-and-spatial-data/6.5.1.1-import.md)).
10. Provide a reason for submitting the change request in the field at the bottom of the panel\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (48).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
11. Click the **Submit A Change Request** button. This results in the creation of the change request, which you can consult in the _Change Requests_ module by clicking the **View change request** button in the message that appears.\

## Submitting a change request for an existing Geo-Object

Submitting a change request to modify an existing Geo-Object can be done in four steps by the Registry Contributor with the curation mandate over the relevant Geo-Object Type:

1. Open the Geo-Object in the editing view
2. Capture the information you would like modify
3. Specify the reason for submitting a change request
4. Submit the change request

The Geo-Object-specific editing view can be reached by the Registry Contributor through three different modules in GeoPrism Registry:

* _Change Requests_
* _Lists and Spatial Data_
* _Explorer_

The following subsections describe how to reach the editing view through each of these modules.

### Reaching the Geo-Object editing view through the _Change Requests_ module

This is the fastest way to reach the Geo-Object editing view when the Registry Contributor knows for which Geo-Object they want to submit a change request, without having to first look at the list.

1. Navigate to the _Change Requests_ module.\
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)
2.  You will find the _Submit a new change request_ section at the bottom of the screen that opens.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (42).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
3.  In this section, select the Geo-Object Type, specify the date for which you want to view the information associated with the Geo-Object, and the name of the Geo-Object (_note:_ the options from which to choose will appear as you start typing the name of the Geo-Object and you can then choose from these options).\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
4.  Click the **View Geo-Object** button. This will open the Geo-Object editing view.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (49) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Reaching the Geo-Object editing view through the _Lists and Spatial Data_ module

The Registry Contributor can choose this option when they are looking at a list for one of the Geo-Object Types for which they have the curation mandate, and see something that needs to be modified, completed or updated.

1.  Navigate to the _Lists and Spatial Data_ module.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
2.  Click on the Geo-Object Type for which you need to submit a change request.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (55).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
3.  Open the list set for which you want to submit the request.\


    <figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/X_0trX8KDayCoHrCDGiHnsb9y7IsFbWS5KWkRqXrMMkXChsfgBxVX1tcp5OA3kjndlGoyRzKnc1C6p-Xh4VN3N0Wl8vD7WcBZrOGWJJ9Vs666Y_3rpj2Bf5o85g0OcsOV2dt_LW7Q9b-HmM4CEA1gV9w0jYXmRc73mkL7-5wtzqr6LNjD0UO83AGNg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
4.  Open the working version of the list for one of the instances of the set.\


    <figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UcEBBLa3adi5AOUjCb3FueJtx8B6Ru74t45sFz5-xNiLqO2sYP4PvbFVZOqkiC4-vycixGREyxhIu6mlIwLuVHr_-_C7hIGm5HRkJag_ugnyGsbFv9Be3MHYiqL4gQ8s0sw37QEvpN9cg1S7e85eo3Y18NZkTsV4-Wisq94RB8m41_U1XGAFQ8qbjg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
5.  In the list that has opened, search for the Geo-Object for which you want to submit a change request (for example by using the search functionality attached to each attribute).\


    <figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Tfs8Z1IT8jgcK0WDLljEzhvpCeMrV_3RitZK2HmejzjggGrguySbWkWZmKC1gtGTf60thPetkUK5gxVGNrV7Y0km5NYOz_6qXK7IXZZaoXTL7Hw9PBFB36kw8SegYtZ0NTpJFRheilmmuIr0dXccRN8RBiDXHzH5ziF-LRofkCOD2BySv3xNo29vg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
6. Click on the view icon for the Geo-Object (![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (3) (1).png>)) .
7.  This will open the Geo-Object on a map with a pop-up.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
8.  Click on the **Edit** button in the pop-up. This will open the editing view for the Geo-Object\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Reaching the Geo-Object editing view through the _Explorer_ module

The Geo-Object editing view can be reached in two ways when using the _Explorer_ module:

1.  By following an approach similar to the _Change Request_ module. In this case, the Registry Contributor will use the search bar in the upper left of the Explorer module. Please note that this functionality does not require for the Geo-Object Type to be specified and does not give access to the dropdown of options as the name of the Geo-Object is being typed. As such, it might return a large number of Geo-Objects of different types.

    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
2. By accessing the Geo-Object editing view while looking at the spatial data for a specific Geo-Object Type over which the Registry Contributor has the curation mandate.

The following steps allow you to reach the editing view of a Geo-Object while looking at its geometry:

1.  In the _Explorer_ module, with the layer for the Geo-Object Type of interest already displayed, click on the Geo-Object for which you want to submit a change request. This will display a pop-up for that Geo-Object.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
2.  Click the **Edit** button in the pop-up box. This will open the Geo-Object editing view:\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (47).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## **Capturing and submitting a change request to modify a Geo-Object**

Once the Registry Contributor has reached the Geo-Object editing view through one of the channels described in the previous section, they can fill in and then submit a change request to modify an existing Geo-Object

To start this process, the Registry Contributor has to click on the **Edit** button located at the bottom of the Geo-Object panel (seeing the button might require to scroll down quite significantly depending on the number of attributes the Geo-Object has):\


<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (58).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From there, the Registry Contributor will be able to fill in and submit a change request for the Geo-Object, for the following changes:

* Changing its period of existence
* Changing its validity
* Modifying the temporal validity (start/end date) of an attribute, parent in a hierarchy or the geometry
* Adjusting the value of an attribute, parent in a hierarchy or geometry without changing the temporal validity of the information
* Adding or deleting an instance of information for a given attribute, hierarchy, geometry or period of existence

To change the period of existence of a Geo-Object:

1.  Open the Geo-Object setting tab ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png>)\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (34).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
2.  Change the start or end date of the period of existence (note the orange frame that now appears around the _Exist_ section in the panel, the current value appearing below the field for which the value has been changed, and the red dot appearing in the other tabs):\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (44).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
3.  Adjust the temporal validity (start and end date) of the information captured in the other tabs to match the new period of existence of the Geo-Object. Once this is done, the dots on all the tabs will have turned orange\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
4.  Specify the reason for submitting the change request in the _Reason_ field and click the **Submit A Change Request** button.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (19) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
5.  This results in the creation of the change request, which you can consult in the _Change Request_ module by clicking on the **View change request** button in the message that appears.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (59).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To change the validity of a Geo-Object:

1.  Open the Geo-Object setting tab ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png>)\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (34).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
2.  In the _Validity_ section of the tab, change the value for the validity from "Valid" to "Invalid" (note the orange frame that now appears around the _Validity_ section in the panel and the current value appearing below the field. In this case no dots appear for the other tabs as setting the Geo-Object as invalid has no impact on this information):\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (50) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
3.  Specify the reason for submitting the change request in the _Reason_ field and click the **Submit A Change Request** button.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
4.  This results in the creation of the change request, which you can consult in the _Change Request_ module by clicking the **View change request** button in the message that appears.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (30) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To modify the temporal validity (start/end date) of an attribute, parent in a hierarchy or of the Geo-Object geometry:

1.  Open the relevant tab for the type of information you’d like to change the temporal validity for (attribute, hierarchical information or geometry):\


    <figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OpmqK8JAraX-dssqC5KUjU7zubRcUle3oI1Y5u8awrGq2IpDwREuxVmCuna_pGTr-18F4E_CmvczpiNzcUY25gIfWLTMDd__mZaauLZC66ZdkPklx6qBUoaFfWsp6-Rp2qyNARjjSqCjPJ_ElnwQaS27ZbHYpLVD9loeR1qwwJONAlpFHvBWroPO1A" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
2.  Scroll to the instance of a(n) attribute/hierarchical information/geometry value you would like to change the temporal validity for. Adjust the start and end date for the instance using the designated date pickers. Also adjust the validity period of other instances of the same attribute/hierarchical information/geometry to remove any temporal validity overlaps and ideally gaps as well.\

Users can then directly edit their requested changes, in a similar fashion to in the Geo-Object editing view.

For change requests that require official documentation as evidence for the change, reference documents can be uploaded in the change request. While still in edit mode of the change request, click on **Choose File** under _Reference Documents_ to browse for a file to attach, and click upload. Multiple documents can be attached to a change request.
