# 6.5.3.1. Creating a historical event

{% hint style="info" %}
Registry Administrators and Registry Maintainers can create historical events for the organization they are a part of.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to the Historical Events module either by clicking the module icon in the main menu page or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/H3tS5zDSURiDer5lhQIgP8OeRy9E5SqiQucIDYS1Gd93gd0LGj9afNdH7qsLV635Pj-mfaWI-hMaLxbqdAqfKDXcqXCtfM\_eMWSsJ\_tn9vYybTU1qlQ3LGLm0lt8I5r5\_qYVKkTvyPoRHfjoAEXE0d2Yr6xJ\_YhhGQTUTZ3ayn7eohKRkLuX\_Wbo)) on the upper right corner and selecting Historical Events.\

3. A window will open with fields to be filled with the following information on the historical event:
   1. Event Date field (required field): type or select the date of when the historical event happened or came into effect
   2. _Description_ (optional): type a short description of the historical event.
   3. _Geo-Object Type Before_ (required): choose the type of the Geo-Object before the historical event happened.
   4.  _Geo-Object Type After_ (required): choose the type of the Geo-Object after the historical event happened.\\

4. Once the fields have been filled (the example below shows the merging of two shires into one), a new section will appear below that will allow you to recreate the historical event. This new section has four columns:
   1. _Before:_ The name and unique identifier of the Geo-Object before the historical event
   2. _Impact:_ Impact of the change to the Geo-Object (full or partial). This is automatically assigned depending on the historical event being represented
   3. _After:_ The resulting name and unique identifier of the Geo-Object after the historical event
   4.  _Type:_ Type of change that happened (merge, split, reassign, upgrade, downgrade). The _merge_, _split_ and _reassign_ types are automatically assigned depending on the historical event being represented. The _upgrade_ and _downgrade_ types appear as a dropdown menu and the user will have to choose the correct type.\\

5.  Click the **+ New instance** button. Two new fields will appear. With each field, you will be able to choose the corresponding Geo-Object before and after the historical event.\\

6. If at any point after the step 5 you realize that you had put the wrong event date or chosen the wrong Geo-Object Type in the Geo-Object Type Before and/or Geo-Object Type After fields, you will have to delete the instance fields first before being able to modify the date or the Geo-Object Types.
   1.  To delete the instance fields, click the delete icon button (![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BqJIZs4hQ6BtecNvr\_N16-ii0-If7Z4JYQovEF8KuO-Osz3YymvJXdr\_TZIQNvR9JKU3TRWn1PKNnnTdcly1ydoiBQIViXLhs\_4fm4K4QBbdZt0e8QNt2Z2t4UauMs20rUQ8GzwrDXOpNgzNPxvBzIwyQANF9DS02PzgTIBCCblq\_UVpNvCeJcYu)).\\

   2. After modifying the necessary fields, repeat step 5 then proceed to step 7.
7.  Click on the field in the _Before_ column. A list of Geo-Objects will appear based on the Geo-Object Type you selected in the _Geo-Object Type Before_ field. If you do not see the name and unique identifier of the Geo-Object before the historical event (as only the first 7 Geo-Objects in the list are shown), type the name of the Geo-Object for it to appear. Click on the Geo-Object name.\\

8.  Click the field in the _After_ column. A list of Geo-Objects will appear based on the Geo-Object Type you selected in the \_Geo-Object Type Afte\_r field. If you do not see the name and unique identifier of the Geo-Object after the historical event (as only the first 7 Geo-Objects in the list are shown), type the name of the Geo-Object for it to appear. Click the Geo-Object name.\\

9.  Notice that at this point, the values in the _Impact_ and _Type_ columns are automatically assigned. These could still change depending on the historical event being represented. A simple visual representation of the historical event will also appear in the upper right side of the window. This could also still change depending on the historical event being represented.\\

10. If there is more than one Geo-Object involved in the historical event being represented, click the **+ New instance** button and fill out the fields again as many times as needed. In the example below, the merging of two shires into one is being represented.\\
