# 3.4.1. Install a new locale

Installing a locale enables the GeoPrism Registry to be translated to that language. This is the first step to enable a GeoPrism Registry instance to be translated. All locale options that can be installed in the GPR can be found [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java8locales-2095355.html#util-text).

You must install all the locales you expect your users to need. Sometimes there are slightly different locales that all need to be included because a browser may have only one version and not the other. As an example, Khmer has two locale versions (_kh\_KM_ and _kh_). Both of these locales must be installed and imported to ensure the Khmer language is shown in all browsers.

1.  Navigate to the **Settings** page and scroll to the 'Localization' section.\\

3. Select the language and country (the list of countries does not relate to the language that has been selected at this stage), and provide a display label for the new locale in the default locale and any existing locales.
4. Click **Submit**.
5. Installing a new locale adds a radio button option in the hamburger menu for that locale, to allow users to toggle between the default and installed locales.\
