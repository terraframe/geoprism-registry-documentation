# 3.5. System email management

GeoPrism Registry uses email settings to send email notifications to users of the system, in particular account creation invitations and automated change request notifications. Email configuration must be done by a System Administrator.

GeoPrism Registry is not directly capable of sending emails by itself. It must be connected to a remote email server which is capable of sending those emails on behalf of GeoPrism Registry. These instructions will enable you to configure the connection with that remote email server.

**Note:** The system only works with Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) compliant email servers.
