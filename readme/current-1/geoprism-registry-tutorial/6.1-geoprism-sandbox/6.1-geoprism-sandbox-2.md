# 6.1.3. Content

The sandbox contains fake data that has been generated to facilitate testing sessions and demos that would cover a large number of use cases, including changes over time.

'Tolkien land' was initially created for a training that took place in the Philippines in 2019. It has since been expanded for GeoPrism Registry demonstration purposes.

## 6.1.3.1. Geo-Object Types

The Tolkien dataset contains Geo-Object Types under the curation mandate of three different organizations:

* Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA)
  * Provinces - Polygons
  * Counties - Polygons
  * Shires - Polygons
  * Villages - Points
* Ministry of Health (MOH)
  * National Hospitals - Points
  * Referral Hospitals – Points
  * Health Centers – Points
  * Health Posts – Points
  * Catchment areas – Polygons
  * Community Health Workers - Points
* Ministry of Education (MOE)
  * Universities - Points
  * Colleges - Points
  * Secondary Schools - Points
  * Primary Schools - Points

## 6.1.3.2. Hierarchies

Organization-specific hierarchies based on the above Geo-Object Types and the geographic location (latitude/longitude) or the geographic extent (polygon) of each Geo-Object have also been configured for the Tolkien dataset.

The hierarchies created per organization are as follows:

* MOHA
  * Administrative structure hierarchy: hierarchy showing how the different administrative divisions are aggregated from the lowest level to the highest.\
