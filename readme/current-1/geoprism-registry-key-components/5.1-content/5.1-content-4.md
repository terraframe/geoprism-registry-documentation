# 5.1.5. Lists

A **list** is a tabular representation of the data elements associated with all the active, and past active, geographic objects (records) of a given type at a given point in time.

Lists represent the most familiar way for users to look at the information associated with any type of geographic object. When they are authoritative and curated by the mandated governmental entity, these lists, referred as **master lists** in this case, also serve as a ground reference to assess the completeness, uniqueness, timeliness, validity, and consistency of the geospatial data also hosted in a common geo-registry, as well as a denominator for the implementation of any public health program.

For example:
