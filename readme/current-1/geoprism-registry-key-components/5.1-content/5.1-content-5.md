# 5.1.6. Geospatial data

Also referred to as spatial data, **geospatial data** corresponds to information about the locations and shapes of geographic features and the relationships between them, usually stored as coordinates and topology (e.g., geographic location of health facilities, boundaries of administrative unitsâ€¦).

As GeoPrism Registry only handles types of geographic objects that can be managed in a list, it stores these in vector format geographic information system (GIS) layers. Raster format GIS layers cannot be uploaded to the platform.

GeoPrism Registry is able to handle the three modes of representation of geographic features in the vector format: points, lines, or polygons (Figure 5.3).
