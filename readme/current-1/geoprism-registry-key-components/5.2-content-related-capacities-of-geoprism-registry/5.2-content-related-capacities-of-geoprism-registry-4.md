# 5.2.5. Documentation (metadata)

Documenting the content of GeoPrism Registry in a way that informs the users if such content corresponds to their needs is key to the proper use of this content.

At this stage, GeoPrism Registry allows the authorized user to fill, manage and share a metadata profile for the following key elements managed in the platform:

* Organization
* User Geo-Object types and groups
* Hierarchies
* Lists
* Spatial data

The content of such a profile is different for each of these elements and described in more detail in [section 6](../../../../versions/current/geoprism-registry-tutorial/).
