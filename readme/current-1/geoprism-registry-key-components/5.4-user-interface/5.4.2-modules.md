# 5.4.2. Modules

The functionalities of GeoPrism Registry are organized in modules accessible from the home page or the burger menu. The functionalities available in each module depend on the user role (see [section 5.3](../../../current/geoprism-registry-key-components/5.3-user-roles-and-their-rights)).

The modules currently included in GeoPrism Registry are as follows:

The general layout of modules is structured in four ways:

1. A unique window containing a set of fields to be completed (Import)
2. A unique window with horizontal sections that can expand depending on the actions being done (Scheduled Jobs, Change Requests, Curation)
3. A window separated into two vertical panels (Geo-Object Types and Hierarchies, Lists and Spatial Data)
4. A unique window with side panels that can be displayed or hidden (Explorer)

For types 1 and 2, the user will start from the top of the window to complete the desired action.

For type 3, the user will first have to select items (Geo-Object Types, hierarchies) in the left panel for the information to appear in the right panel and then be able to complete the desired action in that panel.

For type 4, the user might first have to expand one of the panels before being able to complete the desired action.
