# 5.4.1. Home page

The home page is the first view the user sees after logging into GeoPrism Registry. It is organized in such a way that it allows users to:

1. Access each module by clicking on the corresponding module icons
2. Access each module from the burger menu
3. Access the settings from the burger menu
4. Switch locales for the interface
5. Access their own user information by clicking on the username next to the burger menu
6.  Log out from the burger menu\\

The functionalities provided by GeoPrism Registry are organized in modules. The modules that a user has access to is determined by their role (see [section 5.3](../../../current/geoprism-registry-key-components/5.3-user-roles-and-their-rights)).

For example, the home page will look like this when accessed by a user having a Registry Contributor role:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/pasted image 0.png>)
