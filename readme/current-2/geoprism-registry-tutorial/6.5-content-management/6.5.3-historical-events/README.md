# 6.5.3. Historical events

The _Historical Events_ module allows users to capture the changes to Geo-Objects such as when there are splits, merges, reassignments, upgrades (moving up the hierarchy), or downgrades (moving down the hierarchy). It also presents a visual representation of the Geo-Object's changes over time.
