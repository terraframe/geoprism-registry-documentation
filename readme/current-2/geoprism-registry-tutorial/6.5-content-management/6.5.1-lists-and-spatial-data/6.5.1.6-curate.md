# 6.5.1.6. Curating lists and spatial data

{% hint style="info" %}
Two types of semi-automatic curation are implemented in GeoPrism Registry:

1. The System Administrator, Registry Administrator and Registry Maintainer can check if some of the records in the working list do not have a geometry.
2. GeoPrism Registry automatically produces tasks in the _Curation_ module each time a new historical event (see [section 6.5.3](../../../../../versions/current/geoprism-registry-tutorial/6.5-content-management/6.5.3-historical-events.md)) requires for some changes to be applied by the Registry Administrator or Registry Maintainer on relevant Geo-Objects (for example, the split of a district would require for the health facilities located in a part of it it to be reassigned to the new one that has been created)

Apart from the above, the System Administrator, Registry Administrator, Registry Maintainer and Registry Contributor role can also use the sort functionality in an open list to identify Geo-Objects with empty values for a given attribute.
{% endhint %}

To identify the Geo-Objects that do not have a geometry in a list (the check is performed in the list and not the graph database, meaning that it is performed only for the temporal validity of that list, date or period):

1.  Go to the _Lists and Spatial Data_ module either by clicking the module icon on the homepage or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ieAODNcwrlKZ6iUiZnYlbLGZmQJiEse\_Z8mls7B1vwiKHOfldO3TWH3smxfa1IJQb\_BhxM7c6iTe--Wm0sPvlovt4jp-DaoMkTqq5MNslg-imIrXqyoa3A3Fnq-Ct\_7AAaQzW-xMCIbev1kGSUU8xN5v8iFIayG4z8c4H78mU80Ms6J\_4PBB1ghQw)) in the upper right corner and selecting **Lists and Spatial Data**.\\

2.  In the left sidebar, find and click the Geo-Object Type for which you would like to identify the Geo-Objects without a geometry for a given list (health center for example). Open the set containing the list presenting the temporal validity for which you want to perform the curation (the frequency-based list in this case):\\

3.  Open the working version of the list instance for which you want to perform the curation (_2022-01-01_ in this example).\\

4.  In the list that opens, click the **Run curation** button\\

5. A curation report will appear:
   1.  If there is at least one Geo-Object for which the geometry is missing in the list, the report will state for which Geo-Object this is the case.\\

   2.  If all the Geo-Objects have a geometry, then the report will be empty.\\

6. The last curation run will remain accessible until the next one by clicking on the link on the right of the **Run Curation** button.\

7. Go back to the list and address the missing geometries, if possible.

To view the tasks generated in relation to captured historical events:

1.  Go to the _Curation_ module either by clicking the module icon on the homepage or by clicking the hamburger menu (![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LXLYgQWXwF0Rm7eHKexpUu\_GXCMOZeSIZSyoj08-me4GjBUwtbljSg5P5twFI3HRGtbRvwD6L6cq0YyYZirbgNV45ESEyeBZPGvQDokvpyUyA88pGI5HyxeW7fvvpPz6\_vSMOeLuk62zspLP\_uedmw\_jlEURxV6ACuRE4p-fpiGrvrqD86w26a6Z9Q)) in the upper right corner and selecting **Curation**.\\

    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
2.  In the _Curation_ module, there are two sections: _Open Tasks_ and _Completed Tasks_. In the _Open Tasks_ section, you will see the tasks related to Geo-Objects over which you have the curation mandate and for which hierarchy related information might need to be changed due to a historical event captured for one of its parents. In the example below, as the Ministry of Health Registry Administrator or Registry Maintainer, you are being informed that the _Santa Rosa Shire_ has been merged into the _Bacong Shire_ on 9/15/12 and suggested to look if any of the national hospitals located in the Santa Rosa Shire may need to be reassigned to the Bacong one starting from 9/15/12\\

3. To learn more about the event mentioned in the task, you can go to the _Historical Events_ module to explore the particular historical event the Geo-Object is a part of (see [section 6.5.3](../../../../../versions/current/geoprism-registry-tutorial/6.5-content-management/6.5.3-historical-events.md)) to know how to explore historical events.
4. The number of changes you would have to apply depends on the number of geo-objects impacted by the historical event that has been captured. In the above task for example, all the national hospitals located in the Santa Rosa shire before 04/20/07 will have to be reassigned to the Bacong shire after that date. Depending on the number of changes you have to apply, you may either:
   1. Import a spreadsheet containing the geo-objects that are being impacted together with the new parent information (See Section 6.5.1.1 above to know how to import a spreadsheet).
   2. Edit each impacted Geo-Object separately using the Lists and Spatial Data module (see Section 6.5.1.4 above to know how to edit an existing Geo-Object).
5.  Once the changes have been made, go back to the _Curation_ module. Find the task that has been addressed and mark it as complete by clicking the **Complete** radio button. The task will now be moved to the _Completed Tasks_ section.\\

6. If you have incorrectly marked a task as complete, you may go to the _Completed Tasks_ section, find the particular task, and mark it as open again.
