# 6.1.2. Organizations and roles

The fictional Tolkien dataset used in the GeoPrism Registry sandbox has been designed in such a way that it is distributed across three organizations:

* Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA)
* Ministry of Health (MOH)
* Ministry of Education (MOE)

For each of these organizations, a Registry Administrator (RA), Registry Maintainer (RM) and Registry Contributor (RC) user role has been created. Users can also access the demo instance as a System Administrator (SA). Please refer to [section 5.3](../../../current/geoprism-registry-key-components/5.3-user-roles-and-their-rights) for more details on these roles.
