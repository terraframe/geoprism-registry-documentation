# 6.1.1. Purpose

The GeoPrism Registry sandbox is a controlled testing and demo environment that resets at 12:00 AM GMT+1 every day. This allows users to test and learn about GeoPrism Registry's functionalities without the risk of affecting some specific content.

Because of this, the sandbox is used as the reference for all the examples included in the this tutorial.
