# 5.1. Content

GeoPrism Registry is being used to simultaneously host, maintain, update and share **lists** as well as associated **hierarchies** and **spatial data** for the **geographic objects** core to development in general and public health in particular.

The following sections describe in more detail these different elements, as well as those associated with them (geographic features, geographic object types, data elements, classification tables).

Please refer to the latest Health GeoLab Collaborative [guidance](https://healthgeolab.net/DOCUMENTS/Guidance\_Common\_Geo-registry\_Ve2.pdf) on the establishment of a common geo-registry for the simultaneous hosting, maintenance, update and sharing of lists as well as associated hierarchies and spatial data, for specific considerations to take into account when developing such content before uploading it in GeoPrism Registry (quality, unique identifier, master versus non-master list, etc.).
