# 5.3.2. Rights by role

Tables 5.1 and 5.2 outline the rights by role currently implemented in GeoPrism Registry. These are organized according to the steps in the common geo-registry data/information flow (Figure 5.7; see [Ebener (2022)](https://healthgeolab.net/DOCUMENTS/Guidance\_Common\_Geo-registry\_Ve2.pdf)):

The legend for the numbers listed next to each role in Tables 5.1 and 5.2 is as follows:

1. For all organizations
2. For their organization, for all Geo-Object Types
3. For their organization, for Geo-Object Types over which the user has a curation mandate

Two examples on how to the decipher the table for each role:

* Cell highlighted in gray (Table 5.1): the System Administrator role can view the information of all organizations.
* Cell highlighted in blue (Table 5.1): The Registry Administrator can manage data elements (including classification tables) for all the Geo-Object Types and/or hierarchies private to their organization
