# 3.8. Configuration-based type setup

GeoPrism Registry supports automatically building Geo-Object Types, Hierarchies, directed acyclic graphs, and undirected graphs using configurations defined in XML. This is useful for quickly setting up a GeoPrism Registry instance.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Importing type definitions can only be done by a System Administrator.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
XSD (XML Schema Descriptor) describes the structure of an XML document therefore the XSD definitions below describe how the configuration files must be structured for use with Geo-Prism Registry.
