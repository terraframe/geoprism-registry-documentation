# 3.3.2. Invite a user to serve as the Registry Administrator for an organization

Each organization in GeoPrism Registry is managed separately by users with a Registry Administrator role for that organization. Users with the System Administrator role can invite users to create an account with a Registry Administrator role for a given organization.

When logged in as a System Administrator:

1. Go to the **Settings** module from the home page or the burger menu.\
