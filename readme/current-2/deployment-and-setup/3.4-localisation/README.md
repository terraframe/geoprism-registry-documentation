# 3.4. Localization

GeoPrism Registry can be localized to different languages. The default locale of the system is English, however support for other locales can be added. Localization management must be done by a System Administrator.

GeoPrism Registry currently supports the following localization tasks:

* Extending the system to support new locales
* Exporting the localized values of the system to an Excel spreadsheet
* Importing the localized values from an Excel spreadsheet
* Uninstalling locales
