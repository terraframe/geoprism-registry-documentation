# 5.2.6. Languages and character encoding

In addition to the possibility for GeoPrism Registry user’s interface to be localized (see [section 3.4](../../../../versions/current/3-deployment-and-setup/3.4-localisation/)) users have the possibility to import, store and share the information associated with each data element in the local language.

Thanks to the libraries it integrates, GeoPrism Registry is able to cover any language as long as it is based on the [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/) character encoding system.
